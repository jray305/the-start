# the-start
A shot at html and css I can hopefully include in my portfolio one day. 
This will be the start of open source projects and a long road of learning. 
Open to anything beneficial for any coders; tips from the pros to beginners
like myself wanted to get some collaborations going. 
UI inspo from WIX.
